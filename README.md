# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

This project was created with the goal to practice the 3 core disciplines of web development and to provide an educational resource in the process. By creating this website I have made study notes from the Adelaide Web Development Bootcamp prework module accessible through a webpage. This assists students such as myself to learn from and look back on to understand the key concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Through the process of developing this website I gained a greater understanding of the git work flow. I also developed a basic understanding of the core 3 programming languages of web development.
